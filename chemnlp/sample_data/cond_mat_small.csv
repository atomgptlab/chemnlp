noise-induced, ordering phase transition (NIPT) were assumed to be Gaussian and
white in the model of [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{73}, 3395 (1994)]. The
potential scientific and technological interest of this phenomenon calls for a
study of the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum. This task is
facilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic
differential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of
Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a
variance reduced by the self-correlation time (\tau), and whose effect on the
NIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when
the stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\emph{Gaussian} which, being a
\emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \emph{compact-support} one for
(q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from
Gaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other
phenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field
approximation and with an emphasis on the \emph{order parameter} and the
``\emph{susceptibility}''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises'
statistics and spectrum. Even for relatively small (\tau), it is shown that
whereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect of
self-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it. Also, an interesting

  spectrum   The local, uncorrelated multiplicative noises driving a second-order, purely
noise-induced, ordering phase transition (NIPT) were assumed to be Gaussian and
white in the model of [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{73}, 3395 (1994)]. The
potential scientific and technological interest of this phenomenon calls for a
study of the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum. This task is
facilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic
differential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of
Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a
variance reduced by the self-correlation time (\tau), and whose effect on the
NIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when
the stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\emph{Gaussian} which, being a
\emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \emph{compact-support} one for
(q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from
Gaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other
phenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field
approximation and with an emphasis on the \emph{order parameter} and the
``\emph{susceptibility}''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises'
statistics and spectrum. Even for relatively small (\tau), it is shown that
whereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect of
self-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it. Also, an interesting
effect on the susceptibility is seen in the last case.

4395,0705.0393,"Non-saturating magnetoresistance of inhomogeneous conductors: comparison
  of experiment and simulation","  The silver chalcogenides provide a striking example of the benefits of
imperfection. Nanothreads of excess silver cause distortions in the current
flow that yield a linear and non-saturating transverse magnetoresistance (MR).
Associated with the large and positive MR is a negative longitudinal MR. The
longitudinal MR only occurs in the three-dimensional limit and thereby permits
the determination of a characteristic length scale set by the spatial
inhomogeneity. We find that this fundamental inhomogeneity length can be as
large as ten microns. Systematic measurements of the diagonal and off-diagonal
components of the resistivity tensor in various sample geometries show clear
evidence of the distorted current paths posited in theoretical simulations. We
use a random resistor network model to fit the linear MR, and expand it from
two to three dimensions to depict current distortions in the third (thickness)
dimension. When compared directly to experiments on Ag$_{2\pm\delta}$Se and
Ag$_{2\pm\delta}$Te, in magnetic fields up to 55 T, the model identifies
conductivity fluctuations due to macroscopic inhomogeneities as the underlying

ability to accurately determine intrinsic switching field distributions in
interacting granular magnetic materials such as perpendicular recording media.
In particular, we study how this methodology fails for large ferromagnetic
inter-granular interactions, at which point the associated strongly correlated
magnetization reversal cannot be properly represented by the mean-field
approximation, upon which the $\Delta H(M,\Delta M)$ method is based. In this
study, we use a 2-dimensional array of symmetric hysterons that have an
intrinsic switching field distribution of standard deviation $\sigma$ and
ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interactions $J$. We find the $\Delta H(M,\Delta
M)$ method to be very accurate for small $J/\sigma$ values, while substantial
errors develop once the effective exchange field becomes comparable with
$\sigma$, corroborating earlier results from micromagnetic simulations. We
furthermore demonstrate that this failure is correlated with deviations from
data set redundancy, which is a key property of the mean-field approximation.
Thus, the $\Delta H(M,\Delta M)$ method fails in a well defined and
quantifiable manner that can be easily assessed from the data sets alone.

505,0704.0506,Dimensional crossover of quantum critical behavior in CeCoIn$_5$,"  The nature of quantum criticality in CeCoIn$_5$ is studied by low-temperature

H=5 T a crossover scale $T^\star\approx 0.3$ K is observed, separating
$\alpha(T)/T\propto T^{-1}$ from a weaker $T^{-1/2}$ divergence. We ascribe
this change to a crossover in the dimensionality of the critical fluctuations
which may be coupled to a change from unconventional to conventional quantum
criticality. Disorder, whose effect on quantum criticality is studied in

For instance, if the new node attaches to the contact which is closest to the

smallest degree, the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a random

",cond-mat.quant-gas,"Creation and detection of vortices in polariton condensates   We investigate theoretically the creation, persistence and detection of
quantized vortices in nonequilibrium polariton condensates within a stochastic
classical field model. The life time of the quantized vortices is shown to
increase with the spatial coherence and to depend on the geometry of the
condensate. The relation with superfluidity in conventional superfluids is

407,0704.0408,Photoconductance of organic single-molecule contacts,"  We study the dc conductance of organic single-molecule contacts in the
presence of external electromagnetic radiation (photoconductance). In agreement
with previous predictions, we find that the radiation can lead to large
enhancements of the conductance of such contacts by bringing off-resonant
levels into resonance through photoassisted processes. In our analysis we make
use of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, the
photoconductance can be expressed in terms of the transmission function in the
absence of the radiation. The conductance enhancement is demonstrated for
oligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure is
calculated based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the exponential
decay of the conductance with the length of the molecule can be replaced by a
length-independent value in the presence of radiation.

  Study","  We investigate the phase diagram of a dimerized Bose-Hubbard model, using
density matrix renormalization group technique. We find a new phase, which is
the coexistence of superfluid and bond-wave phases, due to the effect of
dimerization. Experimentally dimerization in optical lattice can be realized by
using two counter propagating laser beams of different wavelengths. Apart from
the conventional superfluid to Mott insulator transition, we find a new quantum
phase transition: from superfluid-bond-wave to Mott insulator-bond wave phase.
Our study suggests a rich phase diagram which can be easily probed.

uncertainty (or path entropy) can be measured by the Shannon information and
that the maximum entropy principle and the least action principle of classical
mechanics can be unified into a concise form. It is argued that this action
principle, hence the maximum entropy principle, is simply a consequence of the
mechanical equilibrium condition extended to the case of stochastic dynamics.

3054,0704.3055,"Disclinations, dislocations and continuous defects: a reappraisal","  Disclinations, first observed in mesomorphic phases, are relevant to a number
of ill-ordered condensed matter media, with continuous symmetries or frustrated
order. They also appear in polycrystals at the edges of grain boundaries. They
are of limited interest in solid single crystals, where, owing to their large
elastic stresses, they mostly appear in close pairs of opposite signs. The
relaxation mechanisms associated with a disclination in its creation, motion,
change of shape, involve an interplay with continuous or quantized dislocations
and/or continuous disclinations. These are attached to the disclinations or are
akin to Nye's dislocation densities, well suited here. The notion of 'extended
Volterra process' takes these relaxation processes into account and covers
different situations where this interplay takes place. These concepts are
illustrated by applications in amorphous solids, mesomorphic phases and
frustrated media in their curved habit space. The powerful topological theory
of line defects only considers defects stable against relaxation processes
compatible with the structure considered. It can be seen as a simplified case
of the approach considered here, well suited for media of high plasticity
or/and complex structures. Topological stability cannot guarantee energetic
stability and sometimes cannot distinguish finer details of structure of
defects.
